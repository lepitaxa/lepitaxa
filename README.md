## Introduction
This project aims to provide a modern, up-to-date phylogeny-based classification of the large insect order Lepidoptera (Butterflies & Moths) in a simple and lightweight format.

It consists of a single, somewhat minimalist and easy to navigate webpage including the entire lepidopteran taxonomy, with varying degrees of detail between the groups depending on their importance and available research data. Taxonomic data and classification changes are based on proper scientific data (in most cases referenced directly below the affected taxon), preferably precise phylogenetic studies.

The simplicity and public access of the data via GitHub allows anyone, hobbyists, enthusiasts and researchers alike, to add, correct, modify or use the taxonomic data. Contributions to the project are very welcome! More details on how to work with Lepitaxa data and about data structure guidelines can be found below.

This GitHub repository also provides a place to discuss data, propose changes and report issues. The preferred working language is English, with the backup language being German. For the time being, my personal role in this project is to maintain and moderate everything, review changes and additions and merge approved ones into the main branch. The Lepitaxa webpage is generated automatically from the main branch of this repository via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
